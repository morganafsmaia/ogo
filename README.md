# Ogo

## Why Ogo?

Ogo is a game inspired by games I played in my childhood with my family, it brings back the nostalgic experience for adults and introduces kids to a classic game dynamic in an fun, simple, approachable way. It's a merge of pictionary, charades and trivial pursuit.
Since today's games and apps are focused on one type of game or another, and usually either paid or full of ads. Therefore, this is a open-source project, so feel free to share, build on and have fun with it.

## Tech overview

Ogo is a web-based app, which does not store any user data.

## Timeline

Ogo will be build in ~2 weeks as my personal project assignment, as part of my process to become a full-stack web-developer trainning at BSSA.
